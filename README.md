Discussion
I used the following technologies: HTML, Javascript & Nodejs (Express).

This inventory for a grocery store includes categories and items. When the user goes to the homepage he/she can choose a category to view, and then get a list of every item in that category. Items and categories have all CRUD-methods. Images can be uploaded for items. Destructive actions (like deleting and updating) require the user to enter a password (user: admin, password: foobar).
