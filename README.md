I used the following technologies: NodeJS, HTML and CSS.

This inventory for a store is implemented with NodeJS/Express. It includes categories and items that are stored in a MongoDB-database. When the user goes to the homepage he/she can choose a category to view, and then get a list of every item in that category. Items and categories have all CRUD-methods. Images can be uploaded for items. Destructive actions (like deleting and updating) require the user to enter a secret username and password (user: admin, password: foobar). For the views pug-templates with Bootstrap and grids are used. The app is fully responsive and can be viewed on screens of all sizes.

A live version of this app can be found at https://store-inventory22.herokuapp.com
